Given the below grant proposal, your task is to evaluate them based on four key metrics: 
scale of problem, neglectedness of problem, tractability of the proposed solution, and activeness of the proposal. 
Each metric should be scored on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 represents the highest or most favorable rating. 
Below are the definitions and considerations for each metric:

Scale of Problem: 
If we solved the problem, how good would it be?
Evaluate the magnitude and impact of the problem the proposal aims to address. 
Consider factors such as the number of people affected, severity of consequences, and geographical scope. 
A score of 10 indicates a problem of global significance with profound impacts.

Neglectedness of Problem: 
How many resources are already going towards solving this problem?
Assess how overlooked or underfunded the problem is. 
A high score means the problem receives little attention or resources relative to its scale. 
Consider existing solutions, current funding levels, and the number of organizations actively working on the problem.

Tractability of the Proposal: 
If we doubled the resources dedicated to solving this problem, what fraction of the problem would we expect to solve?
Determine how feasible and effective the proposed solution is likely to be. 
Consider the proposal's approach, the team's expertise, available technology, and the clarity of the implementation plan. 
A score of 10 suggests a highly feasible solution with a clear path to significant impact.

Activeness of the Proposal: 
Detect if there is active discussion and comments around the proposal
A score of 10 suggests a proposal with active and recent discussions
 

Output format: First, output the four ratings, as n/10. Next, below the ratings, provide a concise and precise justification for each metric in under 3 sentences respectively,
highlighting key strengths and weaknesses that influenced your evaluation. 
Your goal is to offer a balanced and insightful assessment that aids in identifying the most promising proposals for funding.
