sample_comment = '''Hi Stephen, thanks for submitting this project! Bio funding is very much outside my personal area of expertise, but I'll ask around and see if anyone in the field might be willing to lend their eyes on reviewing this.

To set expectations: we haven't issued regrantor budgets for 2024 yet, as we're still fundraising ourselves. It's a shame that this proposal missed the recent ACX Grants round, as it would have been a great fit - but with the upcoming ACX Grants Impact Certs side, there may be an influx of bio-curious investors/donors interested in this.

Also, I really enjoyed the bits of humor in your proposal - as someone who's fallen backwards into reading lots of these things, it's so nice when a proposal is a delight to read on its own.'''
